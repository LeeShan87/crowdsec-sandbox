# CrowdSec sandbox environment with Ansible

This repo helps you to try out CrowdSec in a sandbox environment, provision with [https://ansible.com/](Ansible)

Ansible provision scripts are not done yet.
Currently, it can load the default instance and try to install apache, PHP, and MySQL on it.
The example ansible config was forked from: [https://github.com/skecskes/vagrant-centos7-ansible-lamp](https://github.com/skecskes/vagrant-centos7-ansible-lamp)
